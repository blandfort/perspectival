There are two stands on the route: stand A, with a 50ml sports drink sachet and stand B with a 250ml bottle or a 10ml sachet. You are told that you can pick a drink at stand B only or at both stand A and stand B. Before the marathon started, the marathon organizers used a powerful algorithm for predicting what you would do given these options. If they predicted that you would choose to stop by stand B only, they placed a 250ml bottle in stand B. However, if they predicted that you would choose to pick a drink from both stand A and stand B, then they placed a 10ml sachet in stand B.

    "      - The user should then be able to call get_feature passing using feature name, and depending on type of feature the model name(s) -> What if instead of a name attribute, we write a name method that returns the class name? Then the user doesn't have to know two things to refer to one feature\n",
